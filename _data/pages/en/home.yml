  items:
    - title: "Coroutines"
      icon: "coroutines"
      text: "Lightweight coroutines for efficient concurrent execution. No colored <code>async</code> functions. Just do <code>spawn()</code> and go!"
    - title: "Non-blocking I/O"
      icon: "io"
      text: "<code>fread</code>, <code>fwrite</code>, <code>file_get_contents</code>, <code>ob_start</code>, Curl, MySQL, PostgreSQL and other APIs out of the box. Regular PHP functions now work asynchronously without extra effort."
    - title: "Async Web Servers"
      icon: "web-servers"
      text: "Support for the model: multiple requests — one PHP process."
    - title: "Cooperative Cancellation"
      icon: "cancellation"
      text: "Simple and flexible API for coroutine cancellation, covering various scenarios."
    - title: "Structured Concurrency"
      icon: "structured-concurrency"
      text: "Control coroutine lifetime with <code>Scope</code> sandbox. Manage groups of coroutines via <code>TaskGroup</code>."
    - title: "PDO Pool"
      icon: "pdo-pool"
      text: "Connection pooling built right into <code>PDO</code>. Automatic connection management for maximum performance."
    - title: "Channel"
      icon: "channel"
      text: "Type-safe data exchange between coroutines. Buffered and unbuffered channels for producer/consumer patterns."
    - title: "Futures"
      icon: "futures"
      text: "Deferred results for asynchronous computations. Composition via <code>awaitAll</code>, <code>awaitFirst</code> and flexible result management."
    - title: "Context"
      icon: "context"
      text: "Context propagation through the entire coroutine tree. Timeouts, deadlines and operation cancellation with automatic resource cleanup."
