## Introduction {#introduction}

`PHP TrueAsync` is a project that implements true asynchrony in PHP by modifying the Zend core, the I/O library,
database libraries, socket libraries, and other functions.

`PHP TrueAsync` implements the transparent asynchrony paradigm without colored functions,
which minimizes code changes and eliminates library segmentation.
In other words, when using coroutines, you use the same functions without changes or with minimal changes.

## Installation {#installation}

`PHP TrueAsync` is available in three variants:
* Docker image
* Pre-built packages for popular distributions
* Source code for manual building
